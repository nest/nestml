Name: aeif_cond_exp_implicit -  Conductance based exponential integrate-and-fire neuron
                         model according to Brette and Gerstner (2005).

Description:
aeif_cond_exp_implicit is the adaptive exponential integrate and fire neuron according
to Brette and Gerstner (2005).
Synaptic conductances are modelled as alpha-functions.

This implementation uses the embedded 4th order Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg solver with
adaptive step size to integrate the differential equation.

The membrane potential is given by the following differential equation:
C dV/dt= -g_L(V-E_L)+g_L*Delta_T*exp((V-V_T)/Delta_T)-g_e(t)(V-E_e)
                                                     -g_i(t)(V-E_i)-w +I_e

and

tau_w * dw/dt= a(V-E_L) -W

Parameters:
The following parameters can be set in the status dictionary.

Dynamic state variables:
  V_m        double - Membrane potential in mV
  g_ex       double - Excitatory synaptic conductance in nS.
  dg_ex      double - First derivative of g_ex in nS/ms
  g_in       double - Inhibitory synaptic conductance in nS.
  dg_in      double - First derivative of g_in in nS/ms.
  w          double - Spike-adaptation current in pA.

Membrane Parameters:
  C_m        double - Capacity of the membrane in pF
  t_ref      double - Duration of refractory period in ms.
  V_reset    double - Reset value for V_m after a spike. In mV.
  E_L        double - Leak reversal potential in mV.
  g_L        double - Leak conductance in nS.
  I_e        double - Constant external input current in pA.

Spike adaptation parameters:
  a          double - Subthreshold adaptation in nS.
  b          double - Spike-triggered adaptation in pA.
  Delta_T    double - Slope factor in mV
  tau_w      double - Adaptation time constant in ms
  V_th       double - Spike initiation threshold in mV
  V_peak     double - Spike detection threshold in mV.

Synaptic parameters
  E_ex       double - Excitatory reversal potential in mV.
  tau_syn_ex double - Rise time of excitatory synaptic conductance in ms (alpha
                      function).
  E_in       double - Inhibitory reversal potential in mV.
  tau_syn_in double - Rise time of the inhibitory synaptic conductance in ms
                      (alpha function).

Integration parameters
  gsl_error_tol  double - This parameter controls the admissible error of the
                          GSL integrator. Reduce it if NEST complains about
                          numerical instabilities.
