   Name: amat2_psc_exp - Non-resetting leaky integrate-and-fire neuron model
                         with exponential PSCs and adaptive threshold.

   Description:
   amat2_psc_exp is an implementation of a leaky integrate-and-fire model
   with exponential shaped postsynaptic currents (PSCs). Thus, postsynaptic
   currents have an infinitely short rise time.

   The threshold is lifted when the neuron is fired and then decreases in a
   fixed time scale toward a fixed level [3].

   The threshold crossing is followed by a total refractory period
   during which the neuron is not allowed to fire, even if the membrane
   potential exceeds the threshold. The membrane potential is NOT reset,
   but continuously integrated.

   The linear subthresold dynamics is integrated by the Exact
   Integration scheme [1]. The neuron dynamics is solved on the time
   grid given by the computation step size. Incoming as well as emitted
   spikes are forced to that grid.

   An additional state variable and the corresponding differential
   equation represents a piecewise constant external current.

   The general framework for the consistent formulation of systems with
   neuron like dynamics interacting by point events is described in
   [1]. A flow chart can be found in [2].

   Remarks:
       - The default parameter values for this model are different from the
         corresponding parameter values for mat2_psc_exp.
       - If identical parameters are used, and beta==0, then this model shall
         behave exactly as mat2_psc_exp.
       - The time constants in the model must fullfill the following conditions:
         - tau_m != {tau_syn_ex, tau_syn_in}
         - tau_v != {tau_syn_ex, tau_syn_in}
         - tau_m != tau_v
         This is required to avoid singularities in the numerics. This is a
         problem of implementation only, not a principal problem of the model.
       - Expect unstable numerics if time constants that are required to be
         different are very close.

   Parameters:
   The following parameters can be set in the status dictionary:

   C_m          double - Capacity of the membrane in pF
   E_L          double - Resting potential in mV
   tau_m        double - Membrane time constant in ms
   tau_syn_ex   double - Time constant of postsynaptic excitatory currents in ms
   tau_syn_in   double - Time constant of postsynaptic inhibitory currents in ms
   t_ref        double - Duration of absolute refractory period (no spiking) in
                         ms
   V_m          double - Membrane potential in mV
   I_e          double - Constant input current in pA
   t_spike      double - Point in time of last spike in ms
   tau_1        double - Short time constant of adaptive threshold in ms
                         [3, eqs 2-3]
   tau_2        double - Long time constant of adaptive threshold in ms
                         [3, eqs 2-3]
   alpha_1      double - Amplitude of short time threshold adaption in mV
                         [3, eqs 2-3]
   alpha_2      double - Amplitude of long time threshold adaption in mV
                         [3, eqs 2-3]
   tau_v        double - Time constant of kernel for voltage-dependent threshold
                         component in ms [3, eqs 16-17]
   beta         double - Scaling coefficient for voltage-dependent threshold
                         component in 1/ms [3, eqs 16-17]
   omega        double - Resting spike threshold in mV (absolute value, not
                         relative to E_L as in [3])

   The following state variables can be read out with the multimeter device:

   V_m          Non-resetting membrane potential
   V_th         Two-timescale adaptive threshold

   Remarks:
   tau_m != tau_syn_{ex,in} is required by the current implementation to avoid a
   degenerate case of the ODE describing the model [1]. For very similar values,
   numerics will be unstable.
