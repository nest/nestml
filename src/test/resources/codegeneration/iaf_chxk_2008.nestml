Name: iaf_chxk_2008 - Conductance based leaky integrate-and-fire neuron model
                      used in Casti et al 2008.

Description:
iaf_chxk_2008 is an implementation of a spiking neuron using IAF dynamics with
conductance-based synapses [1]. It is modeled after iaf_cond_alpha with the
addition of after hyper-polarization current instead of a membrane potential
reset. Incoming spike events induce a post-synaptic change of conductance
modeled by an alpha function. The alpha function is normalized such that an
event of weight 1.0 results in a peak current of 1 nS at t = tau_syn.
