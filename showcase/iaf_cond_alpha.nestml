Name: iaf_cond_alpha_neuron - Simple conductance based leaky integrate-and-fire neuron
                       model.

Description:
iaf_cond_alpha is an implementation of a spiking neuron using IAF dynamics with
conductance-based synapses. Incoming spike events induce a post-synaptic change
of conductance modelled by an alpha function. The alpha function
is normalised such that an event of weight 1.0 results in a peak current of 1 nS
at t = tau_syn.

Sends: SpikeEvent

Receives: SpikeEvent, CurrentEvent, DataLoggingRequest
