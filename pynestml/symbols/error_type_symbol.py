    """
    Originally intended to only be a 'Null type' for the TypeSymbol hierarchy,
    it is now also a device to communicate errors and warnings back to a place where they can be properly logged
    (we cant do that here because we don't know t he source-position).
    Thought about using Exceptions but that would lead to loads of code duplication in the
    visitors responsible for expression typing.
    In the end a little bit of ugliness here saves us a lot throughout the project -ptraeder

    p.s. could possibly resolve this by associating type-symbol objects with expressions they belong to.
    The field for that is already present from Symbol and we already instantiate types for every expression
    anyways
