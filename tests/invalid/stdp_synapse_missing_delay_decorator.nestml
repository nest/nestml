stdp - Synapse model for spike-timing dependent plasticity
#########################################################

Description
+++++++++++

stdp_synapse is a synapse with spike time dependent plasticity (as defined in [1]_). Here the weight dependence exponent can be set separately for potentiation and depression. Examples:

=================== ==== =============================
Multiplicative STDP [2]_ mu_plus = mu_minus = 1
Additive STDP       [3]_ mu_plus = mu_minus = 0
Guetig STDP         [1]_ mu_plus, mu_minus in [0, 1]
Van Rossum STDP     [4]_ mu_plus = 0 mu_minus = 1
=================== ==== =============================
