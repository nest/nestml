        I_foo A = 42 mA
        V_3 V = I_foo / 5 nS

            ---> we expect I_foo to be 42 mA
            ---> we expect "float I_foo" to be 42

            ---> we expect V_3 to be 8.4 MV
            ---> we expect "float V_3 = 8.4"


    CASE 2:

        >>>>> in combination with preferred prefix for CONDUCTANCE = nano
        >>>>> in combination with preferred prefix for CURRENT = 1 (ampere)
        >>>>> in combination with preferred prefix for VOLTAGE = M (megavolt)

        I_foo A = 42 mA
        V_3 V = I_foo / 5 nS

            ---> we expect I_foo to be 42 mA
            ---> we expect "float I_foo" to be 0.042

            ---> we expect V_3 to be 8.4 MV
            ---> we expect "float V_3 = 8.4"



        For each variable and for each numeric literal: multiply by its preferred prefix; then result will be in SI units!

        V_3 V = I_foo / 5 nS
              = (42 * 1E-3) / (5 * 1E-9)   # in Volt
              = 8.4E6  # in Volt

        Then divide the whole thing by preferred prefix of left-hand side variable, in this case, Mega (1E6):

              = 8.4E6 / 1E6
              = 8.4
