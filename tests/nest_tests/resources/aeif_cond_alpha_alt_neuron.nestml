# aeif_cond_alpha - Conductance based exponential integrate-and-fire neuron model
# ###############################################################################
# 
# Description
# +++++++++++
# 
# aeif_psc_alpha is the adaptive exponential integrate and fire neuron according to Brette and Gerstner (2005), with post-synaptic conductances in the form of a bi-exponential ("alpha") function.
# 
# The membrane potential is given by the following differential equation:
# 
# .. math::
# 
# C_m \frac{dV_m}{dt} =
# -g_L(V_m-E_L)+g_L\Delta_T\exp\left(\frac{V_m-V_{th}}{\Delta_T}\right) -
# g_e(t)(V_m-E_e) \\
# -g_i(t)(V_m-E_i)-w + I_e
# 
# and
# 
# .. math::
# 
# \tau_w \frac{dw}{dt} = a(V_m-E_L) - w
# 
# Note that the membrane potential can diverge to positive infinity due to the exponential term. To avoid numerical instabilities, instead of :math:`V_m`, the value :math:`\min(V_m,V_{peak})` is used in the dynamical equations.
