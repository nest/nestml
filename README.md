# NESTML: The NEST Modelling Language

NESTML is a domain-specific language that supports the specification of neuron models in a precise and concise syntax, based on the syntax of Python. Model equations can either be given as a simple string of mathematical notation or as an algorithm written in the built-in procedural language. The equations are analyzed by the associated toolchain, written in Python, to compute an exact solution if possible or use an appropriate numeric solver otherwise.
