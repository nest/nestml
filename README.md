# NESTML: The NEST Modelling Language

NESTML is a domain-specific language for neuron and synapse models. These dynamical models can be used in simulations of brain activity on several platforms, in particular [NEST Simulator](https://nest-simulator.readthedocs.org/).

NESTML combines an easy to understand, yet powerful syntax, with good simulation performance by means of code generation, through a flexible and user-friendly toolchain.
