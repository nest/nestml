   Name: mat2_psc_exp_nestml - Non-resetting leaky integrate-and-fire neuron model with
   exponential PSCs and adaptive threshold.

   Description:
   mat2_psc_exp_nestml is an implementation of a leaky integrate-and-fire model
   with exponential shaped postsynaptic currents (PSCs). Thus, postsynaptic
   currents have an infinitely short rise time.

   The threshold is lifted when the neuron is fired and then decreases in a
   fixed time scale toward a fixed level [3].

   The threshold crossing is followed by a total refractory period
   during which the neuron is not allowed to fire, even if the membrane
   potential exceeds the threshold. The membrane potential is NOT reset,
   but continuously integrated.

   The linear subthresold dynamics is integrated by the Exact
   Integration scheme [1]. The neuron dynamics is solved on the time
   grid given by the computation step size. Incoming as well as emitted
   spikes are forced to that grid.

   An additional state variable and the corresponding differential
   equation represents a piecewise constant external current.

   The general framework for the consistent formulation of systems with
   neuron like dynamics interacting by point events is described in
   [1]. A flow chart can be found in [2].

   Remarks:
   The present implementation uses individual variables for the
   components of the state vector and the non-zero matrix elements of
   the propagator. Because the propagator is a lower triangular matrix
   no full matrix multiplication needs to be carried out and the
   computation can be done "in place" i.e. no temporary state vector
   object is required.

   Remarks:
   tau_m != tau_syn_{ex,in} is required by the current implementation to avoid a
   degenerate case of the ODE describing the model [1]. For very similar values,
   numerics will be unstable.
