iaf_cond_exp - Simple conductance based leaky integrate-and-fire neuron model
#############################################################################

Description
+++++++++++

iaf_cond_exp is an implementation of a spiking neuron using IAF dynamics with
conductance-based synapses. Incoming spike events induce a post-synaptic change
of conductance modelled by an exponential function. The exponential function
is normalised such that an event of weight 1.0 results in a peak conductance of
1 nS.
