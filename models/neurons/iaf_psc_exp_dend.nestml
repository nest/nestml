iaf_psc_exp_dend - Leaky integrate-and-fire neuron model with exponential PSCs
#########################################################################

Description
+++++++++++

iaf_psc_exp is an implementation of a leaky integrate-and-fire model
with exponential-kernel postsynaptic currents (PSCs) according to [1]_.
Thus, postsynaptic currents have an infinitely short rise time.

The threshold crossing is followed by an absolute refractory period (t_ref)
during which the membrane potential is clamped to the resting potential
and spiking is prohibited.

.. note::
   If tau_m is very close to tau_syn_ex or tau_syn_in, numerical problems
   may arise due to singularities in the propagator matrics. If this is
   the case, replace equal-valued parameters by a single parameter.

   For details, please see ``IAF_neurons_singularity.ipynb`` in
   the NEST source code (``docs/model_details``).
