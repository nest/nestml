izhikevich - Izhikevich neuron model
####################################

Description
+++++++++++

Implementation of the simple spiking neuron model introduced by Izhikevich [1]_. The dynamics are given by:

.. math::

   dv/dt &= 0.04 v^2 + 5 v + 140 - u + I\\
   du/dt &= a (b v - u)


.. math::

   &\text{if}\;\; v \geq V_{th}:\\
   &\;\;\;\; v \text{ is set to } c\\
   &\;\;\;\; u \text{ is incremented by } d\\
   & \, \\
   &v \text{ jumps on each spike arrival by the weight of the spike}

Incoming spikes cause an instantaneous jump in the membrane potential proportional to the strength of the synapse.

As published in [1]_, the numerics differs from the standard forward Euler technique in two ways:

1) the new value of :math:`u` is calculated based on the new value of :math:`v`, rather than the previous value
2) the variable :math:`v` is updated using a time step half the size of that used to update variable :math:`u`.

This model will instead be simulated using the numerical solver that is recommended by ODE-toolbox during code generation.
