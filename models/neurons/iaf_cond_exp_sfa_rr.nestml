iaf_cond_exp_sfa_rr - Conductance based leaky integrate-and-fire model with spike-frequency adaptation and relative refractory mechanisms
#########################################################################################################################################

Description
+++++++++++

iaf_cond_exp_sfa_rr is an implementation of a spiking neuron using integrate-and-fire dynamics with conductance-based
synapses, with additional spike-frequency adaptation and relative refractory mechanisms as described in [2]_, page 166.

Incoming spike events induce a post-synaptic change of conductance modelled by an exponential function. The exponential
function is normalised such that an event of weight 1.0 results in a peak current of 1 nS.

Outgoing spike events induce a change of the adaptation and relative refractory conductances by q_sfa and q_rr,
respectively. Otherwise these conductances decay exponentially with time constants tau_sfa and tau_rr, respectively.
