iaf_psc_delta - Current-based leaky integrate-and-fire neuron model with delta-kernel post-synaptic currents
############################################################################################################

Description
+++++++++++

iaf_psc_delta is an implementation of a leaky integrate-and-fire model
where the potential jumps on each spike arrival.

The threshold crossing is followed by an absolute refractory period
during which the membrane potential is clamped to the resting potential.

Spikes arriving while the neuron is refractory, are discarded by
default. If the property ``with_refr_input`` is set to true, such
spikes are added to the membrane potential at the end of the
refractory period, dampened according to the interval between
arrival and end of refractoriness.

The general framework for the consistent formulation of systems with
neuron like dynamics interacting by point events is described in
[1]_.  A flow chart can be found in [2]_.
