iaf_psc_alpha_adapt_thresh_OU - Leaky integrate-and-fire neuron model
#####################################################################

Description
+++++++++++

This model augments iaf_psc_alpha with an adaptive threshold and additive
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noise.

iaf_psc_alpha is an implementation of a leaky integrate-and-fire model
with alpha-function kernel synaptic currents. Thus, synaptic currents
and the resulting post-synaptic potentials have a finite rise time.

The threshold crossing is followed by an absolute refractory period
during which the membrane potential is clamped to the resting potential.

The general framework for the consistent formulation of systems with
neuron like dynamics interacting by point events is described in
[1]_.  A flow chart can be found in [2]_.

Critical tests for the formulation of the neuron model are the
comparisons of simulation results for different computation step
sizes.

The iaf_psc_alpha is the standard model used to check the consistency
of the nest simulation kernel because it is at the same time complex
enough to exhibit non-trivial dynamics and simple enough compute
relevant measures analytically.

.. note::
   If tau_m is very close to tau_syn_exc or tau_syn_inh, numerical problems
   may arise due to singularities in the propagator matrics. If this is
   the case, replace equal-valued parameters by a single parameter.

   For details, please see ``IAF_neurons_singularity.ipynb`` in
   the NEST source code (``docs/model_details``).
