iaf_psc_delta - Current-based leaky integrate-and-fire neuron model with delta-kernel post-synaptic currents

Description
+++++++++++

iaf_psc_delta is an implementation of a leaky integrate-and-fire model
where the potential jumps on each spike arrival.

The threshold crossing is followed by an absolute refractory period
during which the membrane potential is clamped to the resting potential.

Spikes arriving while the neuron is refractory, are discarded by
default. If the property ``with_refr_input`` is set to true, such
spikes are added to the membrane potential at the end of the
refractory period, dampened according to the interval between
arrival and end of refractoriness.

The general framework for the consistent formulation of systems with
neuron like dynamics interacting by point events is described in
[1]_.  A flow chart can be found in [2]_.

Critical tests for the formulation of the neuron model are the
comparisons of simulation results for different computation step
sizes. sli/testsuite/nest contains a number of such tests.

The iaf_psc_delta is the standard model used to check the consistency
of the nest simulation kernel because it is at the same time complex
enough to exhibit non-trivial dynamics and simple enough compute
relevant measures analytically.
