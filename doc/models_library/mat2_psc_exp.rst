mat2_psc_exp - Non-resetting leaky integrate-and-fire neuron model with exponential PSCs and adaptive threshold

Description
+++++++++++

mat2_psc_exp is an implementation of a leaky integrate-and-fire model
with exponential-kernel postsynaptic currents (PSCs). Thus, postsynaptic
currents have an infinitely short rise time.

The threshold is lifted when the neuron is fired and then decreases in a
fixed time scale toward a fixed level [3]_.

The threshold crossing is followed by a total refractory period
during which the neuron is not allowed to fire, even if the membrane
potential exceeds the threshold. The membrane potential is NOT reset,
but continuously integrated.

.. note::
   If tau_m is very close to tau_syn_exc or tau_syn_inh, numerical problems
   may arise due to singularities in the propagator matrics. If this is
   the case, replace equal-valued parameters by a single parameter.

   For details, please see ``IAF_neurons_singularity.ipynb`` in
   the NEST source code (``docs/model_details``).
