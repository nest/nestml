neuromodulated_stdp - Synapse model for spike-timing dependent plasticity modulated by a neurotransmitter such as dopamine

Description
+++++++++++

stdp_dopamine_synapse is a connection to create synapses with
dopamine-modulated spike-timing dependent plasticity (used as a
benchmark model in [1]_, based on [2]_). The dopaminergic signal is a
low-pass filtered version of the spike rate of a user-specific pool
of neurons. The spikes emitted by the pool of dopamine neurons are
delivered to the synapse via the assigned volume transmitter. The
dopaminergic dynamics is calculated in the synapse itself.
