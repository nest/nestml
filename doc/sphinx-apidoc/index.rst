NESTML is a domain-specific language for neuron and synapse models. These dynamical models can be used in simulations of brain activity on several platforms, in particular the `NEST Simulator <https://nest-simulator.readthedocs.org/>`_.

NESTML combines:

- an easy to understand, yet powerful syntax;
- a flexible processing toolchain, written in Python;
- good simulation performance by means of code generation (C++ for NEST Simulator).

To see what NESTML looks like, please see the :doc:`models library <models_library/index>`. The library contains a variety of models from standard integrate-and-fire to a family of biophysical, Hodgkin-Huxley type neurons, as well as several synaptic plasticity models such as spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) variants and third-factor plasticity rules.

:doc:`PyNESTML <pynestml_toolchain/index>` is the Python-based toolchain for the NESTML language: it parses the model and performs code generation. Modify PyNESTML to add language elements such as new predefined functions, or to add new target platforms in the form of `Jinja <https://jinja.palletsprojects.com>`_ templates.

Internally, differential equations are analyzed by the associated `ODE-toolbox <https://ode-toolbox.readthedocs.io/>`_, to compute an exact solution if possible or to select an appropriate numeric solver otherwise.
